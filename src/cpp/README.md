This C++ implementation is the reference solution to the shortcut problem, and has been copied, as unmodified as possible, from [here](http://ppc.cs.aalto.fi/ch2/).

All subdirectories prefixed with `v?_` contain incrementally improved versions of the initial baseline solution `v0`.

Use the [`build.py` script](/build.py) to compile these libraries.
